Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Project

## Installation

The code can be executed using Jupyter Notebook. 

## Project Requirements

1) Pick a dataset.

2) Pose at least three questions related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used.
    
3) Create a Jupyter Notebook
    - Prepare data:
      - Gather necessary data to answer the questions
      - Handle categorical and missing data
      - Provide insight into the methods you chose and why you chose them
    - Analyze, Model, and Visualize
      - Provide a clear connection between your business questions and how the data answers them.
4) Communicate your business insights:
    - Create a Github repository to share your code and data wrangling/modeling techniques, with a technical audience in mind
    - Create a blog post to share your questions and insights with a non-technical audience
